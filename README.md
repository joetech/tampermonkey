### ChatGPT
[Save Code Button](./ChatGPT-Save-Code-TamperMonkey.js) - Finds all code blocks in a ChatGPT session and adds "Save code" links to them.  When clicked, the link will save the code from the code block, using a filename that matches the language type.  If the page updates with a new code block (which will happen a lot in a session), it will automatically see it and add the link.
